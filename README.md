room accoustic resonances

determining resonances of my loudspeaker/room/microphone system.

keys:

ESC:  quit

cursor up/down:  display scaling

scrollwheel up/down:  volume


note:

there is output and input lag and the system takes a certain time to get vibrating at a certain frequency.
so when you are approaching a peak from the left or the right it will not come out at the same place.
this is only possible with being very slow and patient and waiting until the measurement has settled.
but that is not the purpose of this program.
also there would be other methods to get a spectrum, like white noise and things like that, but this is also not the purpose here.
the purpose of this program is to have fun with pure sine waves and experience the resonances.

standing waves have fixed, localized amplitude minima and maxima.
this means that you will get different results depending on where your microphone is placed.
if you want to "see what you hear" you need to make sure your mic is placed between your ears.

for the lower frequencies you probably need to increase the volume.
be careful, when you start to hear strange sounds from your speakers (or somewhere else?) at a certain frequency, it is probably a good idea not to increase the volume any further there.
i am not responsible for damage to equipment, interior, property or infrastructure if you turned up your volume too high.
also, there's a chance your neighbours may think you are doing some serious construction work in your room.

there is a room mode calculator available online, but i did not get matching results with it.
i dont know why this is.
my room fits the idea of an ideal shoe box pretty well.
of course it has windows and a door and a few objects in it, but still i expected much better matches.

if you want to use this as an instrument like a teremin or a saw, close your eyes, the graphics will only distract you.
